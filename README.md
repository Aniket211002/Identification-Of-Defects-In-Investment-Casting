# Identification-Of-Defects-In-Investment-Casting
Identification of Defects in Investment Casting using Image Processing
Investment casting is a manufacturing process in which a wax or similar pattern is coated with a ceramic material to create a mold. Molten metal is then poured into the mold to create a part. However, investment casting can result in defects that can compromise the quality of the final product. Image processing can be used to identify defects in investment casting and improve the manufacturing process.

#### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use image processing to identify defects in investment casting. The project aims to develop an automated system that can detect defects in the casting process and provide real-time feedback to operators to minimize the number of defects.

#### Methodology
The following steps will be taken to identify defects in investment casting using image processing:

- Image Acquisition: Images of the castings will be acquired using a high-resolution camera.

- Preprocessing: The acquired images will be preprocessed to remove any noise or artifacts that may interfere with the defect detection process.

- Feature Extraction: Relevant features will be extracted from the images using feature extraction algorithms. The features extracted will include parameters such as shape, color, and texture.

- Defect Detection: The extracted features will be used to detect defects in the casting. Defects that will be detected include porosity, cracks, and voids.

- Classification: The detected defects will be classified into different categories based on their severity and type.

- Real-Time Feedback: The system will provide real-time feedback to the operators to enable them to take corrective action immediately.

#### Tools and Technologies
The following tools and technologies will be used to implement the project:

- Python: Python will be used as the main programming language for the project.

- OpenCV: OpenCV is a computer vision library that will be used to process the images.

- TensorFlow: TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library that will be used to develop the machine learning models for the defect detection and classification.

- Jupyter Notebook: Jupyter Notebook will be used as the development environment for the project.

#### Conclusion
- Investment casting is a critical manufacturing process that can produce high-quality parts. However, the process can result in defects that can compromise the quality of the final product. This project aims to develop an automated system that can detect defects in investment casting using image processing. The system will provide real-time feedback to operators to minimize the number of defects and improve the quality of the final product.
